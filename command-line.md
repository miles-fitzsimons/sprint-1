Q: Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

A: You are used to using a windows based user interface to access files and complete other tasks such as editing files. You generally complete such tasks using a mouse to point and click. A command line is an alternative user interface that uses text-based input to, for example, navigate a file system and access and edit files.
